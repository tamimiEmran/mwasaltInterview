      * Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication.
      * High-Definition (HD) mapping and localization.
      * Computing infrastructure (edge/cloud computing, AI chips).
2. Industry Landscape & Key Players:
   * Overview of global leaders in AV development (Tesla, Waymo, Baidu, Mobileye, etc.).
   * Comparative analysis of technological approaches adopted by different companies.
   * Key regulatory and legal challenges impacting AV deployment.
3. Implementation & Use Cases:
   * AV applications in public transport, logistics, and shared mobility.
   * Success stories and case studies of real-world deployments.
4. Data-Driven Insights & Coding Component:
   * Use Python or relevant programming tools to analyze AV datasets (e.g., sensor data processing, AI model demonstration, or traffic pattern prediction).
   * Provide interactive Power BI visualizations for key trends and insights.
Expected Output Format:
* PowerPoint presentation (well-structured, with visuals and data insights) OR
* Power BI dashboard (interactive, with dynamic insights and coding-based analytics).
